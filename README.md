# CS50x Documentation & Solutions

This repository contains my personal documentation and reference code for Harvard's **CS50x** course.  
It is **not** used for submitting problem sets — this repo is only for learning, tracking progress, and organizing my solutions.

This repo exists only for:
- Learning  
- Tracking progress  
- Organizing clean solution files  
- Building a public portfolio
