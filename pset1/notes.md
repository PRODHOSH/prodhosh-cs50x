## What I Learned
- Basics of C syntax: functions, header files, compilation  
- Using `printf`, variables, data types, and operators  
- Getting user input with CS50’s `get_int`, `get_string`, etc.  
- Using loops (`for`, `while`) to repeat actions  
- Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`) to control logic flow  
- Understanding how programs execute step-by-step  
- How to debug using `printf` and careful reasoning  

## My C Programs

### **Hello**
A simple program that prints text using `printf`.  
**Concepts practiced:** syntax, strings, compilation, output formatting.

### **Mario (Less/More)**
Programs that print left-aligned or pyramid-style blocks using loops.  
**Concepts practiced:** nested loops, user input validation, printing patterns, logic flow.

### **Cash**
A greedy algorithm that calculates the minimum number of coins for a given amount of change.  
**Concepts practiced:** loops, integer division, modulo operations, algorithmic thinking.

### **Credit**
A program that validates credit card numbers using Luhn’s algorithm.  
**Concepts practiced:** long integers, digit extraction, loops, math logic, conditionals.

## Challenges Faced
- Handling invalid user input and repeating prompts until correct  
- Understanding how nested loops work in Mario  
- Extracting digits one-by-one for Luhn’s algorithm  
- Managing integer vs. floating-point issues in Cash  
- Breaking problems into small logical steps  

## Concepts Explored
- Data types: `int`, `long`, `string`  
- Loop structures and patterns  
- Condition checking and branching  
- Greedy algorithms and mathematical reasoning  
- Modular arithmetic for digit operations  
- Code readability and structure  

## Key Takeaways
- Small, well-structured steps make complex programs easier  
- Loops and conditions form the backbone of programming logic  
- Algorithms matter even in simple problems  
- Debugging is part of the learning process
