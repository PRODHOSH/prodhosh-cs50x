# pset1 Notes

## Topics Learned
- Basic C syntax
- Functions and return values
- Conditionals and loops
- Getting user input using `get_int` and `get_string`
- Working with integers and ASCII characters

## Programs in this pset
- `hello.c`: printing output with variables
- `mario.c`: nested loops for patterns
- `cash.c`: greedy algorithm for coin change
- `credit.c`: Luhn's algorithm and card validation

## Key Challenges
- Understanding nested loops for the Mario problem
- Implementing the greedy algorithm correctly
- Breaking down Luhn's algorithm step-by-step

## What I found useful
- Dry-running logic before coding
- Using modular functions for readability
