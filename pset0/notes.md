# pset0 Notes

## What I Learned
- Basics of Scratch and how block-based programming works  
- Event-driven programming using broadcasts and sprite interactions  
- Using loops, conditions, and variables to control game behavior  
- Structuring simple logic visually with clear flow

## My Scratch Project
**Galactic Paddle Bounce** is an arcade-style game where the paddle follows the mouse, and the goal is to keep the ball from falling. Each paddle hit increases the score, and the ball bounces back at varying angles for more dynamic gameplay. The project includes a menu system with **Play**, **Instructions**, and **Back** options.

### Challenges Faced
- Managing screen transitions using broadcast messages  
- Creating unpredictable bounce behavior for the ball  
- Ensuring smooth paddle movement aligned with the cursor  

### Concepts Explored
- Broadcast messages for navigation  
- Collision detection between sprites  
- Randomized motion to adjust difficulty  
- Basic UI design inside Scratch

## Key Takeaways
- Logical flow matters even in visual programming  
- Core CS concepts like events, loops, and conditionals appear clearly in Scratch  
- Building small projects builds intuition for later text-based programming
